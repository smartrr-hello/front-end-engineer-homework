# Front End Engineer Take-home Exam

## Project Overview

Your task is to fork this repository and implement several features using Bootstrap, pagination, and CRUD operations. The directions for each stage of the project are outlined below. Each stage should be implemented on a new branch as specified.

Please make sure you follow best practices for front-end development throughout this exercise, including clear and concise code, efficient solutions, and comprehensive testing.

## Directions

1. Styling with Bootstrap (Branch: "1-bootstrap")
Fork the provided repository and create a new branch named `1-bootstrap`. On this branch, your goal is to style the list and search pages using Bootstrap.

Make sure you apply appropriate Bootstrap classes to the existing elements to improve their visual appeal and usability.
Ensure the application remains responsive and user-friendly across different screen sizes.

2. Implementing Pagination (Branch: "2-pagination")
3. 
Create a new branch named `2-pagination`. On this branch, your task is to implement pagination on the list page.

Use your preferred paginator to limit the display to only 5 rows at a time. The paginator should allow users to navigate between pages of content with ease. Ensure the functionality works as expected, providing a smooth user experience.

3. CRUD Operations (Branch: "3-crud")
Create a new branch named `3-crud`. On this branch, you will develop a form to add a new emoji and enable editing of existing emojis.

* Create a form using the data description provided to add new emojis.
* This same form should also enable the editing of existing emojis. Consider how you will allow users to select an emoji for editing.
* Implement a soft delete feature for emojis, including a confirmation modal to verify the user's intention. Soft deleting here means that the emoji should be hidden from view but not permanently removed from the dataset.

After you've implemented these features, push your branches to your forked repository.
